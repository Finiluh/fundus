            "Donna Kelce has praised Taylor Swift‘s new album The Tortured Poets Department. Speaking to People at the Age of Possibility summit in Las Vegas, Travis Kelce‘s mom confirmed, “I listened to the whole album, and I listened to it all morning long when it was released.”",
            "She added, “I was just very impressed. She is a very talented woman, and I think it is probably her best work.”",
            "However, when asked if she had any advice for Swift about growing older, Donna dismissed the idea, noting, “She doesn’t need my advice on anything. In fact, I hope she will give me advice.”",
            "Since the double album’s release last week, fans have speculated that at least two tracks, “The Alchemy” and “So High School,” reference her current relationship with Travis. On “The Alchemy” Swift makes several references to football, singing, “These blokes warm the benches/ We’ve been on a winning streak/ He jokes that ‘It’s heroin, but this time with an E’/ ‘Cause the sign on your heart said it’s still reserved for me/ Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?”",
            "Donna and Swift spent time together throughout the 2023-24 NFL season as they cheered for Travis and the Kansas City Chiefs, who ultimately claimed victory at the Super Bowl. Donna previously spoke about hanging out with Swift on the Got It From My Momma podcast, saying it was a truly surreal experience.",
            "“I feel like I’m in an alternate universe, because it’s something I’ve never been involved with before,” Donna said. “Every week just seems to trump the week before. So it’s really kind of wild, a wild ride.” Trending Billie Eilish Would Like to Reintroduce Herself Team Trump Is Ready to Lose the Supreme Court Immunity Case.

            "Swift and Travis recently attended Coachella together, where they were spotted at sets for Ice Spice, Dom Dolla, and more. The football star recapped the weekend during an episode of his New Heights podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason.",
            "“I like to see it from the fans’ perspective,” Kelce shared. “Because I am a fan of music, I’m a fan of live shows. I want to see it from the front of the stage. We probably could have finessed it that way, but I think it’s just that much more of an experience if you’re in the pit, man, if you’re in the madness with all the fans.”"
