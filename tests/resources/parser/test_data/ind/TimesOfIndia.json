            "These questions have left many flummoxed after an image and a video grab showing undertrial Sandalwood actor Darshan hanging around with notorious rowdy-sheeters inside Bengaluru Central Prison and even making a video call to someone outside the prison surfaced on certain WhatsApp groups.",
            "Police sources have cited two likely reasons behind the photo and the video getting leaked: Rivalry between rowdy-sheeters, and a race to get closer to the celebrity.",
            "Rivalry between rowdy-sheeters Wilson Garden Naga and Cycle Ravi, whose close aide Bakery Raghu is lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison, is believed to have resulted in the photo and video getting circulated on WhatsApp.",
            "Darshan is said to have known Raghu for long. When Darshan was remanded in judicial custody in the Renukaswamy murder case and was lodged in prison, Raghu took it upon himself to ensure a comfortable stay for the actor in jail.",
            "According to a senior police officer, a fortnight later, Naga took over the ‘charge' to ensure material comforts for Darshan, allegedly upon instructions from a politician.",
            "The officer said Naga was supplying Darshan with whatever he needed, including cigarettes and biryani from a well-known eatery. He also made arrangements for him to walk freely between the jail blocks and use the lawn area, the police officer added.",
            "Raghu and his associates took strong exception to Naga's growing proximity to Darshan and wanted to teach him, Kulla Seena — also a rowdy-sheeter — and their associates a lesson.",
            "Raghu then got in touch with an associate of Naga and made him click the photo and the video clip, which were then circulated on WhatsApp, the senior officer said."

            "He further said: \"Since Darshan is powerful and given the possibility of witnesses being influenced and evidence being tampered with, he may find availing a bail that much more difficult now.\"",
            "However, retired superintendent of police SK Umesh said enjoying such privileges in prison will not have much of an impact on Darshan's legal battles."
